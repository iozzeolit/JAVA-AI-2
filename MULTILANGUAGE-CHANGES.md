## Technical Details

### Language Model Directory Structure

```
/
├── vosk-model/         # Legacy single model directory (for backward compatibility)
└── vosk-models/        # New multi-language model directory
    ├── en/             # English model
    ├── ja/             # Japanese model
    ├── vi/             # Vietnamese model
    └── ...             # Other language models
```

### Language Selection Process

1. Default language loaded from config.properties on start
2. User can change language via "Select Language" button
3. When analyzing a file, user can:
   - Use current language
   - Select a different language

### Model Download Process

1. Check if selected language model exists
2. If not, offer to download it
3. Download model from Vosk servers
4. Extract to appropriate language directory
5. Update config.properties with selected language

### Language Codes

The application supports the following language codes:
- `en` - English

Additional languages can be added in the `LanguageModelManager` class.

## Future Improvements
