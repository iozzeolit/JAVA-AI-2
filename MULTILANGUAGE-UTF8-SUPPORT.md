# Multilanguage UTF-8 Support

This document outlines the changes made to improve UTF-8 handling and multilanguage support in the application.

## Changes Made

### 1. UTF-8 Text Handling

- Added `containsNonASCII()` helper method to detect non-ASCII characters in text
- Enhanced text processing for all non-ASCII languages (not just Japanese)
- Added debugging output for Unicode codepoints and byte representation
- Implemented text normalization for consistent UTF-8 handling

### 2. Language Model Management

- Updated model loading to support and verify all language models
- Added validation for UTF-8 configuration settings
- Added support for additional language models:
  - Japanese (ja)
  - Chinese (zh)
  - Vietnamese (vi)
  - Russian (ru)
  - French (fr)
  - German (de)
  - Spanish (es)
  - English (en) - Default

### 3. System Configuration

- Ensured proper UTF-8 encoding is set throughout the Java runtime:
  - File encoding (file.encoding)
  - Native encoding (sun.jnu.encoding)
  - Console output encoding

### 4. Audio Processing

- Optimized FFmpeg conversion settings for all languages with high-quality audio processing

## How It Works

1. Non-ASCII text detection identifies any text containing characters beyond the ASCII range (code points > 127)
2. When non-ASCII text is detected:
   - The application logs detailed information about the text encoding
   - The text is normalized to ensure proper UTF-8 representation
   - Unicode codepoints are displayed for debugging purposes
3. Language detection helps apply language-specific optimizations when known languages are detected

## Testing Multilanguage Support

To test multilanguage support, try processing audio files with:

- English speech
- Japanese speech
- Chinese speech
- Vietnamese speech
- Other non-ASCII languages

The application should now correctly handle text from all of these languages.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with UTF-8 text display:

1. Verify the console can display the language (Use a font that supports the language)
2. Check the Java system properties to ensure UTF-8 is properly set
3. Review the debug output for any encoding issues in the text processing
